# social_network_visualisation

Data_tidying.ipynb contains the work to convert Claude's generated output into a dataframe.

Output_claude.csv and output_scores.csv contain generated data regarding 30 individuals representative of random people born in 1991 around the world. Age_corrected.csv is a modification of their age of death based on expected reductions of life expectancy for different countries and socioeconomic status due to climate change. 

Network.ipynb contains the draft code to calculate the strength of the relationship between those individuals, allowing for visual representation on Gephi (nodes and edges).
